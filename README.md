# Important Note
Twitter decided to suspend the akl_infocouncil bot. They refuse to tell me what rules they belive have been broken and as such this bot is now broken as is twitters appeals process. For that reason i'm looking at creating a Masterdon bot and i'm also looking at creating a Telegram bot. I hope to have more information soon.

# akl_infocouncil_twitter_bot
Code for the twitter bot https://twitter.com/akl_infocouncil

This bot will update hourly depending on if there is any new content.

This code is not endorsed(at least that we know of) or in any way related to Auckland Council and at any point they could by no fault of there own break our bot. 
If they do we will likely know and work to fix the issue but we cannot give any guarantees.

Any issues create a issue in the issue tab above. Pull Requests welcome.
